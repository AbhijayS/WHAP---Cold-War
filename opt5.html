            You know what it feels like to have your family split apart. You feel pity and would like to help him out. Considering your empathy, you decide to go and help. Since you are a soldier, it’s easier for you to get by and get close enough to the wall in order to help. You run toward him to help him escape, but, unfortunately, by the time you get there, you could only see the man’s dead body. Maybe it was a smoke bomb or a trap. Now there’s a dead body lying next to you and you’re in the middle of Berlin, trying to pretend like you’re a soldier. You still have time to turn around, but you might get caught. This might also be your last chance to escape to the west and reunite with your family and maybe find a better job. There are risks involved either way. You finally decide to jump the wall. You just can’t stop being anxious about seeing your family again. Since you’re already dressed as a soldier, you have better chances of survival. It’s getting late at night. You’ve heard about the entrance at Friedrichstrasse. Maybe you can give that a try. You reach the portal in about 10 minutes of walking. There is no one nearby that you can see. You go for it. Your heart is jumping with joy, once you get to the other side. But, the worst of your fears arise, when you see a group of army men on the other side of the wall. You think you can escape, but they spot you. You have no other option than to surrender at this point. They question your identity and they quickly find out that you weren’t doing your job for the country. They tell you that you will now be imprisoned. You ask when they will let you go. Nobody responds.

            The Berlin border was heavily guarded. Over 200 people were shot and killed, while crossing the wall. You will soon be released from the prison because the war is over. You are glad to be able to see your family and friends again. The Berlin Wall finally opened in November of 1989, after about 30 years of separation. Airlift was a common way for US and Britain to send food supplies for the easterners to keep them alive. The Fall of the Berlin Wall signified the end of the Cold War, but more importantly it showed the superiority of capitalism over communist states. The falling of the wall was termed “the greatest street party in the history of the world” with over 2 million people participating in the celebration. People used hammers and picks to chip away sections of the wall. Some did graffiti and spray-painted all over the wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the communist ideology saw a defeat and capitalism became the most influential form of government in the modern world.
