            You grab your knife and tip-toe silently to the side of the tunnel. You can see the shadow closing up in front of you. You have a bad feeling that this might be the last day of your life. Thinking this, you go for the stab. The person crimps down to the floor. You instantly grab his gun and start running as fast as possible. You don’t look behind you. The only way out was to go straight. You’ve been running for another 30 minutes, when you slow down to a walk. Pretty sure that you’ve crossed the wall, you step outside to take a quick look at where where you are. The streets looked different and there were American tanks lined up. You weren’t far away from the border, but you’ve successfully escaped. Congratulations for being one of only 5000 people, among over 3 million people who were separated from their families, to reach West Germany during the Cold War.

            The Berlin Wall finally opened in November of 1989, after about 30 years of separation. Airlift became a common way for US and Britain to send food supplies for the easterners. The Fall of the Berlin Wall signified the end of the Cold War, but more importantly it showed the superiority of capitalism over communist states. The falling of the wall was termed “the greatest street party in the history of the world” with over 2 million people participating in the celebration. People used hammers and picks to chip away sections of the wall. Some did graffiti and spray-painted all over the wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the communist ideology saw a defeat and capitalism became the most influential form of government in the modern world.
