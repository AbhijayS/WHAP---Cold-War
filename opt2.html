            You’ve been hearing about attempts made by other East Germans to cross the Berlin Wall. Over 100 people have been killed while crossing the border, but there were also people who successfully reached the West. There was also the “Death Strip,” a cushion on either side of the Berlin Wall guarded by soldiers to further prevent escapees from fleeing to West Berlin. You acknowledge that there are dangers associated with crossing the wall, so you start thinking about alternative ideas. You've heard about people using the sewers to get to the other side of the city. Upon further thinking, the sewers were all still interconnected, which meant that you can start on one end of East Germany and reach the West, if you know how to dead reckon through the sewers. This seems like a viable path to you. You are convinced to start tonight.
            Travelling down the dark, smelly and muddy path, the compass is your best friend right now. You are sweating horribly, but you are persistent. You start hearing faint noises from far away, so you assume that you are getting close to your destiny. It’s been an hour and a half of walking. Suddenly, you hear footsteps coming toward you. It’s dark and you’re sweating, and the only weapon you have is a small cutting knife you grabbed from your office kitchen. You can see the shadow of a person carrying a gun right across the corner.
