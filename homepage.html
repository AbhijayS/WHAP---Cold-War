            Cold war was started at the end of the World War II and it was a period of tension between world’s superpowers: US and USSR. It was a war of government ideology, capitalism and communism. It was characterized by proxy wars, the iron curtain, scientific and technological breakthroughs and mass production of nuclear weapons. There were key major events during the cold war namely, the Cuban Missile crisis, Vietnam War and the erection of the Berlin Wall. This choose your own adventure game (CYOA) focuses on the Berlin Wall, which separated East from the Western part of Germany, controlled by USSR and US forces, respectively. The USSR built the wall, almost a decade into the war, in order to prevent people from communist East Germany to flee to the west to support a policy known as “containment.” Due to the Berlin Wall, families were separated and over 200 lives were lost, while trying to cross the Berlin Wall.
