            It’s the summer of 1961. Usually, you leave home at about 8am to get to your work at around 9am from your hometown in Steinstücken. The Deutsche Reichsbahn railway is a common and convenient mode of transportation for you and your friends. You are at your work, going through a few letters. Usually, you don’t listen to any music while working, but today you felt like turning on the radio since there weren’t a lot of people at work. In a short while, you hear a message on the radio, which seems like Premier Khrushchev's voice: “The Soviet Government of East Germany is closing down the border between East and West Germany. No emigrant from East Germany is allowed to cross the border, except for one of three borders at Helmstedt, Dreilinden and in the center of Berlin at Friedrichstrasse. In the next few weeks, barbed wire and concrete block wall, called the 'Berlin Wall' will be constructed." For the next two weeks, you’ve struggled to find traces of food. You miss your family a lot. You leave your house often, but businesses have closed down and you often heard the term “Antifaschistischer Schutzwall” from other people around you, meaning that the wall is erected to keep Western fascist ideas and influence out. With no food and loss of family, you are starving for help. What would you do?
