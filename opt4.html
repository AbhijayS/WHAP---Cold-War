            Scared to death, you start running in the opposite direction as fast as you could. You look behind you for a second and you realize that you were now being followed by a German shepherd. To make things worse, now that you are heading back to where you came from, you are even closer to the Soviet territory. The dog catches up to you and bites his jaws into your right leg. Your pants are now all torn up and you are bleeding heavily. You’re trying to kick the dog away, but it doesn’t seem to help. Then, you spot a person in the distance. Calling for help might be your only chance to survive a death from a dog. From far away, the person looks like a German official, so you fear that you will get caught, but you figure that a life in jail is better than no life at all. You ask for help at the top of your voice and the official hears your cries and comes to your rescue. You are taken into custody the next day, but you are glad that you survived.

            The Berlin Wall finally opened in November of 1989, after about 30 years of separation. Airlift became a common way for US and Britain to send food supplies for the easterners. The Fall of the Berlin Wall signified the end of the Cold War, but more importantly it showed the superiority of capitalism over communist states. The falling of the wall was termed “the greatest street party in the history of the world” with over 2 million people participating in the celebration. People used hammers and picks to chip away sections of the wall. Some did graffiti and spray-painted all over the wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the communist ideology saw a defeat and capitalism became the most influential form of government in the modern world.
