            You have a second thought about helping the individual, but you think that you only way you will be able to survive, and see your family again, would be to do your job as a soldier. You know that if you let him go, you will be fired. You point the gun at the man. You can see him through the scope. You really don’t want to do this. The gun goes off and the sound is echoed throughout the city. A few pigeons take off and you can see them overhead. Nothing much happens the rest of the day.

            You often have recurring thoughts about the horrors of the Berlin wall and how you ended up killing a fellow german, just so that you can make some money by supporting communism. Turns out that you develop PTSD later in your life and the Cold War has permanently scarred you, but you are thankful that you have a family to support you. The Berlin Wall finally opened in November of 1989, after about 30 years of separation. The Fall of the Berlin Wall signified the end of the Cold War, but more importantly it showed the superiority of capitalism over communist states. The falling of the wall was termed “the greatest street party in the history of the world” with over 2 million people participating in the celebration. People used hammers and picks to chip away sections of the wall. Some did graffiti and spray-painted all over the wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the communist ideology saw a defeat and capitalism became the most influential form of government in the modern world.
