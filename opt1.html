            You have struggled to get a job in the chaos of the war. The communist regime of East Germany has been drafting soldiers to guard the Berlin War. Seeing no other opportunity to make money, you decide to join the East German army. Now that you can afford food, it’s better than nothing and you kind of like it here. You often call your parents to see how they’re doing. Today you had your first day on the frontlines. You saw a colleague fire at a young person trying to escape. It wasn’t really clear what happened to the young guy. You think it’s immoral to be killing people to stop them from going somewhere, but you still have to do your job. A few weeks later, your day-shift was about to end when you spot a person trying to sneak past the barbed fence. You aim the gun at him. The person is clearly visible through the scope. Your hands start shaking and you start to sweat. If you don’t do your job, you won’t be able to make any money, but at the same time, it makes you uncomfortable to kill someone and you feel pity since you’ve never killed anyone before. What do you do?
